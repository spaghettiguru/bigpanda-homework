The application consists of 2 parts: front-end and back-end.  

It requires **MongoDB** server (4.0.8 community edition) and **NodeJS** (10.15.1) to be installed.  
MongoDB server should be running on the default host (_localhost_) and port (_27017_)

Running back-end server:
1. `cd back-end`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

Running the fron-end:
1. `cd front-end`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

After all front-end running steps are done you should be able to access the UI at http://localhost:3000/
